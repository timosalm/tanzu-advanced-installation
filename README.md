# Unofficial Tanzu Advanced PoC guides for TKG

It's always recommended to go through the official documentation in addition to these guides!
The scripts and commands in this guide were executed on a Linux jumpbox.
The scripts are based on the amazing work done for TKG 1.1 [here](https://github.com/tanzu-end-to-end/clusters).
